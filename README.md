# Java Training: Exercises and Projects

This repository centralizes my learning journey in the Java language, covering everything from the fundamentals of programming logic to the development of complex systems with Spring Boot.

## 🚀 Goal
The main focus is to consolidate concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), exception handling, file manipulation, interfaces, and design patterns through constant practice.

## 📂 Repository Organization
The folders are organized by modules as I progress and evolve in Java, as in the example below:

course-nelio-alves/: Practical exercises and projects from the Complete Java course. (POO, Interfaces, JDBC, JPA/Hibernate).

## 🛠️ Key Technologies and Concepts Applied and Under Learning

Java SE (Standard Edition): Lambdas, Streams, Generics e Collections.

Software Architecture: Dependency Injection, Interfaces, and the SOLID pattern.

Error Management: Exception hierarchy and robust handling with try-catch.

Data Persistence: Reading/Writing files and integrating with databases.
